BKIoT_Lab_2 file contains the unity project and I use unity version 2020.3.31f for this project.
the Python file is used to publicize the information to the mqttserver.tk.
Using instruction:
step 1: open the python file and run it.
step 2: running the unity project.
notice: 
- if not running the python file, the unity project won't be able to take the information about temperature and humidity (display 0)
